** <2011-02-11 Fri>
   I just realize how I could have done this in a way that seems like it might have been much more elegant:
   Sessions (and people, as well), would hold and manage views, eg have a UITableCell, a sessionDetailView, etc.
   They could manage the cacheing of such objects and detroy them / regenerate them.
