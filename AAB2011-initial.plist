		<string>Henry Ford did it. Do we need an &apos;order of magnitude&apos; improvement to sustain Application Development in our region?

This reflective conversation will seek to summarize the themes of the day:

    * New learning
    * New challenges
    * A renewed commitment to regional collaboration</string>

		<string>The hardest part of big projects is that they are BIG. Of course &quot;big&quot; means different things to different people. What some measure in cash, others measure in technology. Little value flows when we focus on the number of people &quot;doing agile&quot;. Big value is more likely to flourish when agility is a tool for overcoming complexity. David speaks to agility as a tool instead of a mandate. Come ready to toss out the book and start taking ownership of a way of working that helps you learn and helps you scale agility to focus on outcome instead of inputs.</string>

		<string>We will have just celebrated the ten-year anniversary of the &apos;Agile Manifesto&apos; and some may find agile to be a bit boring these days --- that there is not much left to discover. Others are just beginning their personal &apos;Agile&apos; journey. Either way, if you look around, there are a host of software development problems just waiting for a solution. Join Mary as she explores these seemingly intractable challenges and offers ideas for innovative solutions that may be coming down the road!</string>

		<string>Have you ever noticed that some of the best conversations at a conference emerge during the coffee breaks? What if you could encapsulate those moments and share them throughout the day? That’s one of the founding principles of Open Space Technology; it’s a free form meeting where attendees control the agenda, timeframe, and discussion.

All the ingredients are present for a highly dynamic, energy-filled, passionate environment where topics run close to the core of human experience. Age, skill-level, background --- it doesn&apos;t matter --- what matters is true, open communication and a chance to hear and be heard!

However, building is just the start. In this hands-on experiential workshop Carol and Michelle demonstrate how to jumpstart the persona creation process; then put those little fictional folks to work to keep your project on task, focus stakeholders, mediate feature discussions and meet both business and user goals.

		<string>The hallmarks of a “good” story card are that it describes business value, can be estimated by those who will do the work, and can be tested. When Lisamarie is asked how to write good story cards, she responds, “You start by writing a couple hundred bad ones.” Like all things, it takes practice to improve. There are, however, ways to write better story cards from the start. This session will explore the good, the bad, and the ugly of story card writing using examples from real projects and will give participants an opportunity to exercise their story writing skills.</string>

		<string>Reading about Agile, talking to people about Agile, and being part of a team that is “going Agile” are all good ways to learn about Agile. But, the best way to truly internalize how a successful Agile project works is by being part of a successful Agile project. The purpose of this workshop is to impart the essence of how a successful Agile project works and the benefits of Agile through a series of hands-on activities. The workshop covers the nuts and bolts of a typical Agile process, from entering new requests as User Stories all the way to “shipping” a product.

Damon will guide the creation of a made-up software project (of the participants’ choosing) to illustrate the Agile Process. Participants will break up into small cross functional teams and work together to write user stories, create a story point scale, use Planning Poker to estimate stories, create a backlog, and “ship” two versions of their software project. Shipping the project will involve iteration planning, backlog grooming, and release planning. There will also be exercises that illustrate the benefits of collocation.</string>

What does it mean to be an effective contemporary &apos;Lean&apos; leader? Join in for a powerful time of face-to-face interaction as we seek collaborative answers.

Mary and Tom wrote the book; actually three books. So, what's the big deal with 'Lean'?

If you have not had the opportunity to glean from the 'Lean' harvest that is sweeping the IT community, there may never be a better opportunity then a conversation beginning with what is occurring in our own back yard.

And we won't stop there. We'll talk openly and candidly about application development in our region and how well we compete on the global stage. Do we have a sustainable prescription or are we simply on life-support?</string>

		<string>Lean offers an opportunity to step back and look at how an organization operates. Once you see it as it really is, you can start to optimize to work faster and better. The Kanban method may be used to build a model contextualized to the needs of an organization, enabling work to flow through to completion in an even, predictable way.

This experiential session allows you to &apos;try out&apos; using Kanban within a team. Janice includes worksheets identifying organization needs, pain points, and how a Kanban system could help. The workshop will focus on change management practices in knowledge work fields such as software development.</string>

    * Computer with Eclipse v.3.5 or Higher, JUnit v.3 or Higher

Two of the (many) principles promoted by Test-Driven Development include “once-and-only-once” and “communicate well.” Those are great principles, but they’re often applied just far enough to create decent, but not super-clean, code.

This workshop focuses on techniques that scrub code really clean. These techniques take a little extra effort to apply but more than pay for themselves by preparing an application for what comes next. You’ll work with Bill and Tom on standard and clean versions of three different systems. You’ll feel the difference extra polish makes for evolving and adding features. And you&apos;ll walk away with improved use of refactoring tools having enjoyed an intense TDD/refactoring workout!</string>

		<string>In soccer (a.k.a. international football), players play individual positions but share core skills, like dribbling, passing and shooting. Their assignments on the field overlap and they interact with everyone on the team. American football is different: players are highly specialized and step onto the field for specific plays. To achieve a whole-team approach in software development Matthew will challenge us to emulate a soccer model. That is, approach work as activities to be accomplished together rather than in separate specialized roles. We’ll also discuss smells and remedies, how Kanban affects teams’ tendencies, and how a whole-team approach addresses the seven wastes in software development.</string>

		<string>Many teams build software that does not behave as expected by stakeholders; add the Agile engineering practice of “Executable Requirements” to your specifications arsenal! Eric and Dan share compelling principles for building excellent executable requirements (or acceptance criteria) that consistently deliver value for your customer.

You will learn collaboration techniques that ensure business and developers have a shared understanding.

And you’ll take back new approaches suitable for developers, business analysts, project managers and testers to ultimately &apos;wow&apos; your customer!</string>

    * What is not technical debt?
    * Why should we care?
    * What is the cost of misunderstanding?
    * What do we do about it?</string>
